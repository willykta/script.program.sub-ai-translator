# Sub-AI Translator Performance Optimization Test Plan

## Objective

Verify that the implemented performance optimizations work correctly across all supported providers and maintain backward compatibility while providing significant performance improvements.

## Test Environment

- Kodi environment with Sub-AI Translator addon installed
- Valid API keys for all supported providers:
  - OpenAI
  - Google Gemini
  - OpenRouter
- Test subtitle files of varying sizes and complexities
- Network monitoring tools to measure performance

## Test Cases

### 1. Connection Pooling Verification

**Objective**: Verify that connection pooling is working correctly and providing performance benefits.

**Test Steps**:

1. Enable detailed logging in Kodi
2. Translate a medium-sized subtitle file (100-200 blocks) with each provider
3. Monitor logs for connection pool usage messages
4. Compare request times with and without connection pooling (fallback mode)

**Expected Results**:

- Connection pool creation and usage messages in logs
- Reduced request times with connection pooling
- Successful fallback to urllib.request when urllib3 is not available

### 2. Parallel Processing Performance Test

**Objective**: Verify that increased parallel processing limits improve translation speed.

**Test Steps**:

1. Translate the same large subtitle file (500+ blocks) with different parallel settings:
   - 1 concurrent request
   - 3 concurrent requests (default)
   - Maximum concurrent requests for each provider
2. Measure total translation time for each setting
3. Monitor system resource usage during translation

**Expected Results**:

- Significantly faster translation times with higher parallel settings
- Proper resource management without system overload
- Correct number of concurrent requests based on configuration

### 3. Batch Processing Efficiency Test

**Objective**: Verify that optimized batch sizing improves processing efficiency.

**Test Steps**:

1. Translate subtitle files with varying block sizes:
   - Small blocks (1-2 lines each)
   - Medium blocks (3-5 lines each)
   - Large blocks (10+ lines each)
2. Monitor batch creation and processing logs
3. Verify batch sizes are optimized based on content length and line count

**Expected Results**:

- Appropriate batch sizes for different content types
- Efficient processing without exceeding provider limits
- Better performance with optimized batch sizing

### 4. Provider-Specific Configuration Test

**Objective**: Verify that each provider uses its specific optimized configuration.

**Test Steps**:

1. Test each provider with its maximum parallel settings:
   - OpenAI: Up to 10 concurrent requests
   - Gemini: Up to 5 concurrent requests
   - OpenRouter: Up to 8 concurrent requests
2. Monitor logs for provider-specific configuration usage
3. Verify rate limiting is working correctly for each provider

**Expected Results**:

- Provider-specific configuration values in logs
- Appropriate rate limiting for each provider
- No rate limit errors with optimized settings

### 5. Error Handling and Fallback Test

**Objective**: Verify that error handling and fallback mechanisms work correctly.

**Test Steps**:

1. Test with invalid API keys to trigger authentication errors
2. Test with network connectivity issues to trigger timeout errors
3. Test with urllib3 not installed to trigger fallback to urllib.request
4. Monitor error handling and recovery logs

**Expected Results**:

- Proper error messages and handling
- Successful fallback to alternative methods
- Graceful degradation without application crashes

### 6. Performance Comparison Test

**Objective**: Measure overall performance improvements compared to the original implementation.

**Test Steps**:

1. Translate the same set of subtitle files with the original implementation
2. Translate the same files with the optimized implementation
3. Compare translation times, success rates, and resource usage
4. Document performance improvements

**Expected Results**:

- 2-5x improvement in translation speed
- Maintained or improved success rates
- Better resource utilization

## Test Data

### Test Files

1. **Small File**: 20-50 subtitle blocks, simple content
2. **Medium File**: 100-200 subtitle blocks, mixed content complexity
3. **Large File**: 500+ subtitle blocks, complex content with special characters
4. **Special Characters File**: Content with non-English characters, emojis, etc.

### Provider Test Matrix

| Provider   | Models to Test                       | Expected Parallel Limit | Expected Batch Size |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| OpenAI     | gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o                  | 10 concurrent requests  | 50 blocks           |
| Gemini     | gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro     | 5 concurrent requests   | 30 blocks           |
| OpenRouter | openai/gpt-4o-mini, anthropic/claude | 8 concurrent requests   | 25 blocks           |

## Success Criteria

1. **Performance Improvement**: At least 50% reduction in translation time
2. **Compatibility**: All existing functionality works correctly
3. **Stability**: No crashes or hangs during translation
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and recovery mechanisms
5. **Resource Usage**: Efficient resource utilization without system overload

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators

1. **Translation Time**: Total time to translate subtitle files
2. **Request Time**: Average time per API request
3. **Success Rate**: Percentage of successfully translated blocks
4. **Resource Usage**: CPU and memory usage during translation
5. **Error Rate**: Number of failed requests and successful recoveries

### Logging Requirements

1. **Connection Pool Usage**: Pool creation and request handling
2. **Batch Processing**: Batch sizes and processing times
3. **Parallel Execution**: Concurrent request management
